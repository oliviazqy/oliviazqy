### 👋 Hi there, I'm Olivia!

A product nerd who enjoys building with AI, tweaking prompts until they’re *just right*, and automating things (yes, even PDFs).

I’ve spent the last 6+ years navigating the wild world of programmatic advertising, leading cross-functional teams, and translating technical chaos into elegant product roadmaps. I like my features measurable, my metrics actionable, and my user stories backed by SQL.

Lately I’ve been diving deeper into generative AI, multimodal agents, and the nitty-gritty of RAG. If it's a blend of data, user empathy, and technical puzzle-solving — I’m probably into it. 

🚀 Always learning. Usually troubleshooting something I broke five minutes ago.
